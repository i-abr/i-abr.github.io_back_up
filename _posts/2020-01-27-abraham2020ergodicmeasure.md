This paper develops KL-Ergodic Exploration from Equilibrium (KL-E 3 ), a method for robotic systems to inte- grate
stability into actively generating informative measurements through ergodic exploration. Ergodic exploration enables
robotic systems to indirectly sample from informative spatial distribu- tions globally, avoiding local optima, and
without the need to evaluate the derivatives of the distribution against the robot dynamics.
