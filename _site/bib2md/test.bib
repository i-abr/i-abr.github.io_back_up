    abstract={

    We develop a hybrid control approach for robot learning based on combining learned predictive models with
    experience-based state-action policy mappings to improve the learning capabilities of robotic systems. Hybrid
    control tools are used to create an algorithmic approach for combining learned predic- tive models with
    experience-based learning. Hybrid learning is presented as a method for efficiently learning motor skills by
    systematically combin- ing and improving the performance of predictive models and experience- based policies.

    This paper develops KL-Ergodic Exploration from Equilibrium (KL-E 3 ), a method for robotic systems to inte- grate
    stability into actively generating informative measurements through ergodic exploration. Ergodic exploration enables
    robotic systems to indirectly sample from informative spatial distribu- tions globally, avoiding local optima, and
    without the need to evaluate the derivatives of the distribution against the robot dynamics.

    We present a data-driven shared control algorithm that can be used to improve a human operator’s control of complex
    dynamic machines and achieve tasks that would otherwise be challenging, or impossible, for the user on their own.
    Our method assumes no a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. Instead, both the dynamics and information
    about the user’s interaction are learned from observation through the use of a Koopman operator.

        This work addresses the problem of robot interaction in complex environments where online control and adaptation
        is necessary. By expanding the sample space in the free energy formulation of path integral control, we derive a
        natural extension to the path integral control that embeds uncertainty into action and provides robustness for
        model-based robot planning.

  abstract={

          Despite the neuromechanical complexity underlying animal locomotion, the steady-state center-of-mass motions
          and ground reaction forces of animal running can be predicted by simple spring-mass models such as the
          canonical spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. Here, we develop a leg damping model that is bilinear
          in leg length and velocity in order to yield improved damping force and ground reaction force prediction.

      Current methods to estimate object shape---using either vision or touch---generally depend on high-resolution sensing.
      Here, we exploit ergodic exploration to demonstrate successful shape estimation when using a low-resolution binary

The rat vibrissal system is one of the most commonly used models to study how the brain encodes and processes somatosensory information. To date, however, researchers have been unable to quantify the mechanosensory input at the base of each whisker, because the field lacks accurate models of three-dimensional whisker dynamics. To close this gap, we developed WHISKiT Physics, a simulation framework that incorporates realistic morphology of the full rat whisker array to predict time-varying mechanical signals for all whiskers.}
