    abstract={This work addresses the problem of robot interaction in complex environments where online control and
adaptation is necessary. By expanding the sample space in the
free energy formulation of path integral control, we derive
a natural extension to the path integral control that embeds
uncertainty into action and provides robustness for model-based
robot planning.}

  abstract={Despite the neuromechanical complexity underlying animal locomotion, the steady-state center-of-mass motions and ground reaction forces of animal running can be predicted by simple spring-mass models such as the canonical spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. Here, we develop a leg damping model that is bilinear in leg length and velocity in order to yield improved damping force and ground reaction force prediction.}

operator theory to the control of robotic systems. We illustrate how the operator can
be used to obtain a linearizable data-driven model for an unknown dynamical process that is useful for model-based control
synthesis.}

  abstract={Although a number of solutions exist for the problems of coverage, search and target localization---commonly addressed separately---whether there exists a unified strategy that addresses these objectives in a coherent manner without being application-specific remains a largely open research question. In this paper, we develop a receding-horizon ergodic control approach, based on hybrid systems theory, that has the potential to fill this gap.}
